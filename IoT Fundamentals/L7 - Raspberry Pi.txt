Raspberry Pi
-------------------------------

The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer, which runs Linux operating systems.

The Pi's GPIO facilities are similar to those on the PICO which we have been using for labs so far.

A number of GPIO libraries exist for the Pi, and support a wide range of languages. The actual GPIO is controlled from
userspace via "ioctls" into a kernel module.

Both low-level and high-level APIs have been implemented on top of this for a range of languages.

We can use code like this:


	import gpiozero as gp

	my_led = gp.LED(17)

	my_led.on()
	my_led.off()


This code assigns the LED wired to pin 17 into the variable "my_led" and turns it on and off.

We can also use pulse-width modulation to control the brightness of an LED:


	import gpiozero as gp

	led = gp.PWMLED(12)

	led.value = 0.5


Additionally, we can use different kinds of inputs to control LEDs:


	import gpiozero as gp


	button = gp.Button(17)
	led = gp.LED(2)

	def pressed():
		led.on()

	def released():
		led.off()

	button.when_pressed = pressed
	button.when_released = released


The code above defines two functions, for pressing and releasing the button. Pressing it turns the LED on, and releasing
it turns the LED off.

It also defines callbacks for the button, such that it will call the correct functions when pressed and released.

MQTT is a standard communications protocol for IoT devices.

It features a publisher, which broadcasts information to a broker, which can then send information on to a subscriber.

A subscriber device can send a message to the broker to say it is interested in receiving its information from now on,
at which point the broker will add it to a list.

From then on, when the publisher gives the broker new information on that topic, it will be forwarded to all subscribers
on that list.
