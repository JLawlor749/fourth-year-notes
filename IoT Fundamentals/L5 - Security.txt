Security
------------------

Security is an essential part of modern networking, but is often overlooked by IoT vendors.

Common IoT security issues include:
	> Default passwords.
	> Single level of access control.
	> Large attack surfaces.
	> Old software.
	> Lack of encryption.
	> Trusted computing.
	> Poor responses from vendors when intrusions are found.

When a user first logs in, we should make them change the default password.

2FA should be enabled by default. Even though we should allow users to disable it, the default should be the most
secure option.

Normal and Admin users should be separated. This can be challenging, as IoT devices often have limited functionality,
but it is worth it to implement stricter security for admin functions.

Attack surfaces should be minimized. If attackers are presented with fewer targets, your system is more secure.

Old software is filled with vulnerabilities.

Old software should only be used if we're sure it's safe.

Working with a low-end or constrained device is a poor excuse for compromising security in this way.

Anything that could potentially be sensitive or private info should be encrypted.

Even data that isn't private should be considered, in order to prevent side channels or network analysis.

There are three types of encryption: Symmetric, Asymmetric, and Hashing.

Symmetric ciphers are those in which the sender and receiver need to shared the same key in advance of the communication.

Asymmetric ciphers have a public key and a private key.
