Arduino Programming
-----------------------

Arduinos have a number of advantages, including that they are very cheap, have a huge range of models, and are hugely
extensible.

There are a family of addon boards called shields that can be used to expand the functionality of the Arduino.

The Arduino board features a microcontroller, reset button, power, voltage regulator, digital I/O, peripheral power,
analogue input, an oscillator, an AREF pin, and LEDs.

AS we can see, they are quite complicated boards.

There is an official Arduino IDE which makes programming for the devices quite easy.

Arduino programs are called sketches, and are typically written in a variant of C++.

They are transferred to the Arduino via the USB port.

Arduino programs should have two main functions, setup(), which initialises, and loop(), which runs continuously.

Unlike a typical C++ program, there is no main() function.

To blink an LED, much like with the other boards, we do "pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT)" in the setup() function, and then
turn it on and off in the loop(), with "digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH)" and "digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW)".

We can also make the LED fade in and out, by giving it values from 0 to 255.

We can also use a potentiometer for input, by using the "analogRead()" function:



	#define LED_PIN 9
	

	void setup() {
		pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
	}


	void loop() {
		int brightness = analogRead(A0);
		brightness = map(brightness, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
		analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness);
	}





This code allows us to control the brightness of the LED using the potentiometer as a control.

It is possible to read in input from a button using similar code, to achieve a similar result:



	#define LED_PIN 9
	# define BUTTOn_PIN 2
	

	void setup() {
		pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
		pinMode(BUTTOn_PIN, INPUT);
	}


	bool led_on = false


	void loop() {
		int button_state = digitalRead(BUTTON_PIN);
		
		if(button_state == LOW) {
			return;
		}

		if(led_on) {
			digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
			led_on = false;
		} else {
			digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
			led_on = true;
		}
	}



There is a class called "Serial" that we can use with Arduino. Because the Arduino doesn't have a screen of its own,
it can't run print statements. However, we can use the Serial class to run these and transmit the output.

This allows us to debug using whatever is connected to the Serial port, which will be out computer.

We start this by running "Serial.begin()" in the setup() function. We need to pass this function an integer called
the baud rate, which is how quickly the computer and Arduino will communicate. We use 9600 for this.

The TMP36 is a temperature sensor, with pins for power in, analogue out, and ground.

The output pin outputs a voltage between 0 and 5 volts, which we use the function (V[out] - 500 / 10) to convert to
Celsuis temperature.
