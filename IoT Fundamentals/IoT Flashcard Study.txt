IoT Flashcard Study
-----------------------------------



What is the core concept behind the 'Internet of Things' (IoT)?
	> Devices with processors and microchips in them to allow for more digital and connective functionality.
	- Connecting everyday electronic devices, which contain cheap and low-power computers, to the internet
	  for enhanced functionality.



What are the two main values to consider at any point in an electrical circuit?
	> Voltage and current.
	- Voltage (V) measured in Volts, and Current (I) measured in Amperes.



In the hydraulic analogy for electronic circuits, what does voltage represent?
	> The amount of fluid.
	- It represents the pressure of the water, or how hard it is being pushed.



In the hydraulic analogy for electronic circuits, what does current represent?
	> The amount of water being pushed.
	- It represents the speed of the water, or how quickly it is moving.



What is the primary function of a resistor in an electronic circuit?
	> To reduce voltage.
	- A resistor reduces the voltage and current of power flowing through it, acting like an electric speed bump.



The degree of resistance (R) is measured in what unit?
	> Ohms.
	- Ohms.
