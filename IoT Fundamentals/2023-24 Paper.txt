1. a) The devices basically all just talk to each other.

1. b) Device to Gateway and Device to Cloud.
	> To Gateway - Data goes through gateway device, then to server.
	> To Cloud - Data goes directly to server.

1. c) No need to pay for cloud infrastructure, better reliability, works well in absence of modern infrastructure.
      Low communication range, high power consumption, more onboard processing.



2. a) Arduino: Cheaper, better for real time processing, better community support.
      Raspberry Pi: More computational power, better multi-tasking, system-on-chip.

2. b) 

2. c) 



3. a) I. Cables and wires, physical transmission.
      II. Transport of packets across network, uses IP.
      III. Ensures reliable delivery, correct sequence of packets, TCP and UDP.
      IV. The end application that processes the data and displays it to the user, HTTP.

3. b) Fog computing is a pattern with a lot of edge computing, a distributed model that processes data locally
      on devices or servers at the edge of the network.

3. c) I. A central unit that receives data from publishers and sends it to subscribers.
      II. Publishes data on a topic to the broker, which then sends it to subscribers who are subscribed to the topic.
      III. Receives data from the broker on topics that it has subscribed to.



4. a) Data in motion is data currently being transmitted, data in use is data currently being processed or used,
      and data at rest is data currently being idly stored.
