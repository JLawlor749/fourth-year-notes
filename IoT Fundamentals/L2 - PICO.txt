Raspberry Pi PICO
------------------------

Specs:
	> RP2040 microcontroller (dual Cortex M0 @ 133MHz, 256KB RAM)
	> 2MB of flash memory (disk space)
	> 26 GPIO pins, SPI and I2C support
	> Software FP support

We are using the PICO 1, of which there are four models.
	> The original PICO 1.
	> The PICO H.
	> The PICO WH.
	> The PICO W.

The PICO WH is the highest-end model, and the one we will be using.

The ground pins are a negative connection, used to complete a circuit.

The GPIO pins, those labelled with GP and then a number, are for general purpose input and output.

MicroPython implements a large subset of Python 3.4 and parts of 3.5.

It runs on the metal, i.e. on systems without an OS.

It supports a wide range of hardware and microcontrollers, not just the PICO.

It is open source and easy to install.

We need to import a library called "machine" to interact with hardware.

We can define an LED with code like:
	> led = machine.Pin("LED", machine.Pin.OUT)

Then we can interact with it with methods like:
	> led.value(1)
	> led.toggle()

We can also read in information from hardware, alongside just outputting to it.

We can read an analogue signal from a potentiometer (these need to go into an ADC port).

We can then import the ADC class in MicroPython, and use the following code snippets:
	> adc = ADC(1)
	> value = adc.read_u16()

This reads a value from the potentiometer into the "value" variable.

Moving a servomotor is a little more complicated, and requires a lot more code.

The PICO has no pins that can do an analogue output, but a digital pin can fake one using pulse width modulation.

Only certain GPIO pins, which are marked with PWM, can perform this.

Essentially, the pins can only do either no volts, or 3 volts. With PWM, we can rapidly switch between them.

The proportion of a given length of time that we spend at zero or three gives us the voltage we're simulating.

For example, if we spend an equal split at zero versus at three, we simulate 1.5 volts.

The faster we can switch between them, the more accurately we can simulate the target voltage.

First, we declare the servo:
	> servo = PWM(Pin(27), freq=50, duty_u16=0)

Then we can define a function that will allow us to move the motor.

Into this function we can take the target angle, and the servo object, as parameters.

We can write an assertion that the angle will be between 0 and 180:
	- assert 0 <= angle <= 180

Then we can define the minimum and maximum, which will be 1802 and 7864 respectively.

The difference between them is then maximum minus minimum.

Then we must define a duty cycle. The duty cycle will be:
	> (angle / 180) * difference + minimum

For example, if we want to go half way, to the 90 degree position:
	> 90/180 = 1/2 = 0.5
	> difference * 0.5 =
