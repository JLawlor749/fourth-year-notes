Google Hacking for Penetration Tester
----------------------------------------------

Google is one of the most powerful databases in the world, and can be used to retrieve a lot of information.

It is important to audit one's internet presence to be aware of what information can be retrieved by someone.

Google also has a number of advanced search techniques, such as different operators that allow a user to narrow down
their search results to a more desirable set.

Operators are divided into a basic set, and an advanced set. The basic set is as follows:
	> The + operator allows a forced inclusion.
	> The - operator allows a term to be excluded.
	> Surrounding a term in "quotes" allows for searching exact phrases.
	> The ~ operator allows searching for synonyms.
	> The . operator is a single-character wildcard.
	> The * operator is an any-word wildcard.
	> The AND operator searches for terms before and after the operator.
	> The OR operator searches for results that include either term, or both.

Moving on to the advanced operators, we have the following.
	> The "site" operator allows you to specify a site or domain, e.g. "site:tudublin.ie"
	> The "filetype" operator allows google searches for specific types of file, e.g. "filetype:pdf"
	> The "info" operator allows google to return information on a domain, e.g. "info:www.tudublin.ie"
	> The "intitle" operator allows you to force results for a term in the page title, e.g. "intitle:Google"
	> The "inurl" operator allows you to force results for a term in the url, e.g. "inurl:index.html"
	> The "intext" operator allows you to force results for a term in the page text, e.g. "intext:free movies"
	> The "cache" operator allows you to find old versions of a site cached on google, e.g. "cache:www.tudublin.ie"
