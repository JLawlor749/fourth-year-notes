A component diagram is a structural diagram in the Unified Modelling language.

It shows how the components of a system are arranged are relate to one another.

System components are modular units that offer a set of interfaces and encapsulate implementation.

These diagrams illustrate how components are wired together to form larger systems, detailing their dependencies and
interactions.

Component diagrams are widely used in system design to promote modularity, and enhance understanding of system
architecture.

Component based diagrams in UML comprise several key elements, each serving a distinct role in illustrating architecture.



1. Component
	> Represents a modular part of the system that encapsulates functionality.
	> Components can be software classes, collections of classes, or subsystems.
	> Symbol - Rectangle with component stereotype.
	> Function - Define and encapsulate functionality, ensuring modularity and reusability.



2. Interfaces
	> Specify a set of operations that a component offers or requires, serving as a contract between the component
	  and its environment.
	> Symbol - Circle for provided interface, half-circle or socket for required interface.
	> Function - Define how components communicate with each other, ensuring that they can be developed and
	  maintained independently.



3. Relationships
	> Depict the connections and dependencies between components and interfaces.
	> Symbol - Lines and arrows.
		 - Dependency is a dashed arrow, and indicates reliance.
		 - Association is a solid line, and indicates a permanent relationship between components.
		 - Assembly connectors connect a required interface of one component to the provided one of another.
	> Function - Visualise how components interact and depend on each other, highlighting communication paths.



4. Ports
	> Represents specific interaction points on the boundary of a component where interfaces are provided or required.
	> Symbol - Small squares on component boundary.
	> Function - Allow for more precise specification of interaction points, facilitating detailed design and
	  implementation.



5. Artifacts
	> Represent physical files or data deployed on nodes.
	> Symbol - Rectangles with the stereotype "artefact".
	> Function - Show how software artefacts like executables or data files, relate to the components.



6. Nodes
	> Represent physical or virtual execution environments where components are deployed.
	> Symbol - 3D boxes.
	> Function - Provide context for deployment, showing where components reside and execute within infrastructure.
