Important Stuff
----------------------------------

Fermat's Little Theorem: If P is prime, then for any integer A, A^P = A(mod P)

Euler's Totient: If A and N are relatively prime positive integers, then A^f(N)≡1(mod N), where f(N) is Euler's totient
function. (A^(totient function(N)) is congruent with 1 mod(N)).

Feistel Cipher: Symmetric encryption design, not specific algorithm. Used for DES. Data block is split, processed in rounds
using a round function and sub-key, then the left and right halves are swapped. This allows for efficient encryption
and decryption using the same logic.

One Time Pad: Uses a single-use truly random key, as long as the message. Theoretically unbreakable, hard to  distribute
keys and to ensure they are truly random/used only once.

Rail Fence Cipher: A simple transposition cipher that rearranges plaintext letters in a zigzag pattern across imaginary
"rails" (rows) and then reads them off row by row to create the ciphertext.

Row Transposition Cipher: Rearranges plaintext letters by writing them into a grid, as rows and columns, and then
reading them out in a different order, typically column by column, based on a secret keyword.
