More Number Theory
--------------------------

Prime numbers only have themselves and 1 as divisors.

They cannot be written as a product of other numbers.

Prime numbers are central to number theory.

Any integer greater than 1 can be factored in a unique way as a combination of amounts of primes multiplied together.

This is known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

Fermat's Theorem states that if P is prime, and A is a positive integer not divisible by P, then Aᵖ⁻¹ = 1(mod P).

This is sometimes referred to as Fermat's Little Theorem.

An alternate form is: if P is prime and A is a positive integer, then Aᵖ = A(mod P).

This theorem plays an important role in public-key cryptography.

Euler's Theorem states that for every A ad N that are relatively prime, A^(∅(N)+1) = A(mod N).

In this, ∅(N), or Phi(N) represents Euler's Totient Function.

It counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer N that are relatively prime to N.

This plays an important role in public-key cryptography as well.

The Miller-Rabin algorithm is typically used to test a large number for primality.

The algorithm is as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TEST(N)

Find integers K, Q, with K > 0, Q odd, so that (N - 1 = 2ᴷQ);

Select a random integer A, 1 < A < N - 1;

If Aᑫ(mod N) == 1, then return ("inconclusive");

For J = 0 to K - 1 do:
	If A²^ᴶᑫ(mod N) == N - 1 then return ("inconclusive");

Return ("composite");

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to 2002 there was no known method of efficiently proving the primality of very large numbers.

All algorithms used produced a probabilistic result.

In 2002 Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena developed an algorithm that efficiently determines whether a given large number
is prime.

This is known as the AKS algorithm. It does not appear to be as efficient as the Miller-Rabin algorithm.

Chinese Remainder Theorem, or CRT, was believed to have been found by Sun-Tsu in around 100 A.D.

It is one of the most useful results of number theory.

It says that it is possible to reconstruct integers in a certain range from their residues modulo a set of pairwise
relatively prime moduli.

It can be stated in several ways.

It provides a way to manipulate potentially very large numbers mod M in terms of tuples of smaller numbers.

However, it is necessary to know beforehand the factorization of M.
