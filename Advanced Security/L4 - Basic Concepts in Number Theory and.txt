Basic Concepts in Number Theory and Finite Fields
---------------------------------------------------------

We say that a nonzero "B" divides "A" if A=MB for some "M", where A, B, and M are all integers.

B divides A if there is no remainder on division.

The notation B|A is commonly used to mean B divides A.

If B|A we say that B is a divisor of A.

If A|1 then A = ∓1.

If A|B and B|A then A = ∓B.

Any B ≠ 0 divides 0.

If A|B and B|C then A|C.

If B|G and B|H, then B|(MG + NH) for arbitrary integers M and N.

If B|G, then G is of the form G = B * G, for some integer G.

If B|H, then H is of the form H = B * H for some integer H.

So then, MG + NH = MBG + NBH = B * (MG + NH).

Given any positive integer N, and any non-negative integer A, if we divide A by N, we get an integer quotient Q, and
an integer remained R, that obey the following relationship:
	- A = QN + R
	- O ≤ R < N; Q = [A/N]

One of the basic techniques of number theory is the Euclidean Algorithm.

It is the procedure for determining the greatest common divisor of two positive integers.

Two integers are relatively prime if their only common positive integer factor is 1.

The greatest common divisor, or GCD, of A and B is the largest integer that divides both A and B.

We can use the notation gcd(A,B) to mean greatest common divisor of A and B.

We can also define gcd(0,0) = 0.

Positive integer C is said to be the GCD of A and B if:
	> C is a divisor of A and B.
	> Any divisor of A and B is also a divisor of C.

An equivalent definition is:
	> gcd(A,B) = max[K, such that K|A and K|B].

Because we require that the greatest common divisor be positive, gcd(A,B) = gcd(A,-B) = gcd(-A,-B) = gcd(-A,B).

In general, gcd(A,B) = gcd(|A|, |B|).

Because all nonzero integers divide 0, we also have gcd(A,0) = |A|.

We stated that two integers A and B are relatively prime if their only common positive integer factor is 1.

This is equivalent to saying that A and B are relatively prime if gcd(A,B) = 1.

Euclid's algorithm allows for easily finding the GCD of two integers.

Essentially, you start with the higher number and the lower one.

The equation starts with the form of HIGHER + LOWER = 0.

You then change it. Replace the higher number with the number of times the lower one goes into it, and replace the
lower number with the remainder of this operation.

So if the numbers are 35 + 8 = 0, the equation becomes (4)(8) + 3 = 0.

This then goes on to (2)(3) + 2 = 0, which becomes (1)(2) + 1 = 0, and lastly (2)(1) + 0 = 0.

Because the last remainder above 0 is 1, the GCD is 1.

The idea of the Modulus is very important to arithmetic theory. If A is an integer and N is a positive integer, we can
define A mod N to be the remainder when A is divided by N, with the integer N being called the modulus.

Thus, for any integer A:
	- A = QN + R		0 ≤ R < N; Q = [A/N]
	- A = [A/N] * N + (A mod N)

Congruent Modulo N - Two integers A and B are said to be congruent modulo N if (A mod N) = (B mod N).

This is written as A = B(mod N).

note that if A = 0(mod N), then N|A.

Congruences have the following properties:
	> A = B(mod N) if N|(A - B)
	> A = B(mod N) implies B = A(mod N)
	> A = B(mod N) and B = C(mod N) imply A = C(mod N)

Modular arithmetic exhibits the following properties.
	> [(a mod n) + (b mod n)] mod n = (a + b) mod n
	> [(a mod n) - (b mod n)] mod n = (a - b) mod n
	> [(a mod n) * (b mod n)] mod n = (a * b) mod n

There are a series of different laws that define the properties of modular arithmetic:
	> Commutative Laws
	> Associative Laws
	> Distributive Laws
	> Identities
	> Additive Inverse
