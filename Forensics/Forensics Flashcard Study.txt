Forensics Flashcard Study
-----------------------------------

What is the definition of computer forensics?

What does it mean for a process to be "forensically sound"?
	> It means that the process extracts the evidence without changing it and in such a way that it can be confirmed
	  as legitimate, allowing it to be admissible in courts.
	- The evidence must remain in its original state during acquisition and throughout the investigative process.



What is the purpose of a Chain of Custody form?
	> This form tracks the people that are in possession of pieces of evidence, and at what times.
