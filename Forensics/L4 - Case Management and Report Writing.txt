Case Management and Report Writing
------------------------------------------

Each case is a project. Any misstep will be pounced upon in court by the opposition. Managing the case as a project helps
to avoid any errors in procedure.

Good reporting allows you to demonstrate good process.

Case flow can be divided into three stages: preparation, investigation, and presentation.

These stages map well to the investigative model.

Preparation is done outside the scope of a conventional investigation:
	> Involves "creating" the case investigation team/department.
	> Policies and procedures are defined.
	> Team roles are defined.

Investigation involves the following:
	> Triage.
	> First response.
	> Scene management.
	> Lab preparation.
	> Evidence handling.
	> Evidence examination.

Triage involves assessing any risks, to people, systems, or data.
	> Mitigate as many risks as possible.
	> Determine priorities.
	> Is saving the data more important than nabbing the culprit?
	> Is identifying the culprit worth a financial loss?

First response uses the crime scene first-response protocols wherever possible.
	> Determine the best method for collecting evidence.
	> Perform live-response if necessary.
	> Collect evidentiary materials in a forensically sound manner.

Crime scene management involves preserving the scene for other investigators.
	> Survey the scene.
	> Document the scene (with photos and videos).
	> Search the scene.
	> Try to virtually reconstruct the crime.

Lab preparation is where we prepare a repository for digital evidence.
	> Sufficient storage.
	> Sufficient security.
	> Ensure proper tools are ready.
	> Ensure personnel are ready to receive evidentiary materials.

Evidence handling involves prevention of environmental contamination.
	> Block electromagnetic transmissions.
	> Maintain excellent chain of custody logs.
	> Have a way to keep devices powered during transport.
	> Don't damage anything.

Evidence examination includes making sure we use the right tool for the job.
	> We document everything we do.
	> Never touch the originals.

Presentation stage, we need to avoid interpretation of results.
	> Present all evidence, both incriminating and exculpatory.
	> Be prepared to back up any statements or findings in the reports.

Report writing is the stage where the final report is written.
	> Case summary.
	> Authorizations, warrants, subpoenas.
	> Procedural documentation.
	> All case notes.
	> All photographs and videos.
	> A conclusion.

Case summary includes information such as the following.
	> Who requested the investigation?
	> Who are the principles involved?
	> When did the incident occur?
	> When was the report filed?
	> What allegedly happened?

Procedural documentation is where we write down the following information.
	> An inventory of items examined.
	> A list of tools used.
	> A timeline of procedures performed.
	> A list of people who performed these procedures.
	> Before/after hash values of evidence image.

Findings is the section detailing how findings were obtained, like tools used, search strings, etc.
	> The results of each action described in the procedural document.
	> A timeline that puts the activities in perspective.

Report conclusion ties all the other parts of the report together.
	> Presents evidence either supporting or refuting the initial claim.
	> Does not itself support or refute the initial claim.

A digital forensics report is a formal document that presents the findings of a digital investigation, often related to
cybercrime, internal audits, or data breaches.

The report must be clear, structured, and contain all relevant details necessary for non-technical readers such as
legal professionals or management.

There really isn't a de-facto standard or format for forensics report writing.

Formatting and layout options are up to the examiner/analyst, or they may be required to follow a template for
organizational policies or jurisdictional court rules.

A sample structure might look like:
	> Title Page
		- Basic details of the case name, report writer, contact info.

	> Table of Contents
		- Apply a structure to the report and offer a ToC at the top of the report.

	> Overview
		- Overview and a summary of the case.
		- What has been asked for with respect to the investigation.

	> Evidence
		- Present the details of the evidence in our chain of custody.
		- Description of hardware, make, model, serial numbers, description, condition, etc.

	> Objectives
		- Describe in detail what you were specifically being asked to do for this investigation.

	> Forensic Analysis
		- This is what you did as part of your forensics investigation.
		- What tools you used.
		- The steps taken, thoroughly documenting what you have done.
		- Describe everything in granular detail.

`	> Relevant Findings
		- Detailed section of report.
		- Include all artifacts and relevant findings on the computer.
		- Analysis and Interpretation:
			> Data Recovery
			> User Actions
			> Indicators of Compromise
		- Each piece of evidence must offer a description that a layperson would understand.

	> Timeline
		- Create a timeline based on the forensic analysis, like access times and login attempts.

	> Conclusion
		- Summary of the investigation, process followed and the findings.
		- Any recommendations for further investigation.

Hardware tools are physical devices.

Software tools run on these physical devices.

Tool types include media capture and analysis, memory capture and analysis, application analysis, and network and
capture analysis.

Moving information from thought to electronic impulse and back goes through a number of doors.

On an electronic level, data is not humanly readable.

On the human level, the CPU can't function.

Abstraction layers move up and down the spectrum.

There are four necessary traits for tools used for digital forensics:
	> Accuracy
	> Verification Capabilities
	> Consistency
	> Usability

If even one of these traits is missing, a tool is unsuitable.
