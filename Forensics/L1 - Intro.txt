Forensics
------------------------
Being able to offer accountability for previous transactions with devices.

This module is 50% CA, and 50% exam.

CA is in 2 pieces, the first being 30% and the second being 20%.

The first will be due the Sunday in week 6.

Computer forensics is the retrieval, analysis, and use of digital evidence in a civil or criminal investigation.

Any medium that can store digital files is a potential source of evidence for a computer forensics investigator.

Computer forensics is a science because of the accepted practices used for acquiring and examining the evidence and
its admissibility in court.

Forensically sounds means that during the acquisition of digital evidence and throughout the investigative process, the
evidence must remain in its original state.

Moreover, everyone has been in contact with the evidence must be accounted for and documented in the Chain of Custody
form.

Crime Investigation
	> Helps law enforcement solve cybercrimes such as hacking, fraud, terrorism, etc.
	> Provides digital evidence that can be legally admissible in court.

Corporate Security
	> Detects insider threats, data leaks, and intellectual property theft.
	> Investigates policy violations within organizations.

Incident Response
	> Identifies how cyberattacks occurred, the scope of damage, and the techniques used by attackers.
	> Helps prevent future incidents by analysing weaknesses.

Data Recovery and Integrity
	> Recovers deleted, hidden, or encrypted files.
	> Maintains the chain of custody so evidence remains authentic and untampered with.

Legal and Compliance Needs
	> Many industries require forensic practices for compliance.
	> Ensures that organizations meet regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

National Security
	> Tracks cyber terrorism, espionage, and cross-border cyber threats.
	> Provides intelligence for defence and security agencies.

One of the main difficulties in defining computer crime is that situations arise where a computer or network was not
directly involved in a crime but still contains digital evidence related to the crime.

As an extreme example, take a suspect who claims to have been using the internet at the time of a crime. Although the
computer played no role in the crime, it contains relevant digital evidence to the investigation.

To accommodate this type of situation, the more general term "computer-related" is used to refer to a crime that involves
computers and networks, including crimes that do not rely heavily on computers.

Notably, some organizations, such as the US Department of Justice and the Council of Europe, use the term cybercrime to
refer to a wide range of crimes that involve computers and networks.

This course covers digital evidence as it applies to any crime, and delves into specific computer crimes that are
defined by laws in various countries.

The term "digital investigation" is used throughout this course to encompass any and all investigations that involve
digital evidence, including corporate, civil, criminal, and military.

The term "computer forensics" means different things to different people.

Computer forensics usually refers to the forensic examination of computer components and their contents, like hard drives,
compact disks, and printers.

However, the term is sometimes used more loosely to describe the forensic examination of all forms of digital evidence,
including data travelling over networks.

To confuse matters, the term "computer forensics" has been adopted by the information security community to describe
a wide range of activities that have more to do with protecting computer systems than gathering evidence.

As the field has developed into several distinct sub-disciplines, including malware forensics and mobile device
forensics, the more general term "digital forensics" has become widely used to describe the field as a whole.

Agencies involved in digital forensics:
	> FBI
	> IRS
	> US Secret Service
	> Federal Law Enforcement Training Centre
	> National White Collar Crime Centre
	> INTERPOL
	> High Tech Crime Investigation Association
	> Computer Technology Investigators Network
	> InfraGard
	> An Garda Siochana
	> New Scotland Yard

File carving is a process used in digital forensics. It looks at extracting data from device storage without using
the file system.

Carving is extracting structured data from a larger set of raw data based on characteristics (patterns) in raw data.

Carving is a powerful process to a digital investigation:
	> Identifies and recovers from raw, deleted, or damaged file systems, memory, or swap space data.
	> Recovering files not recognized by the OS or the filesystem.

File carving is a digital forensics technique used to recover files from unallocated disk space, memory dumps, or corrupted
storage when the file system structures (like FAT, NTFS, or ext tables) are missing or damaged.

File carving is the process or reassembling files from raw data fragments on a disk or memory image, based only on the file
content (signatures, headers/footers, patterns) rather than metadata like filenames, timestamps, or directory paths.

A deleted file may no longer appear in the file system, but its raw data is still present on the disk.

A forensic tool (e.g. Scalpel, Foremost, Autopsy, X-Ways) can carve that image out by recognizing the JPEG header
and footer in raw binary data.

This can be used for:
	> Recovering deleted files.
	> Data breach investigations.
	> Memory forensics.
	> Disaster recovery.

Carving works best for non-fragmented files, and carved files may lack metadata. Highly fragmented files like large
videos may be partially unrecoverable without context.

A header is a sequence of bytes, in HEX or ASCII at the beginning of a file.

It usually contains the magic number, and can identify the file type, and sometimes contains metadata, such as format
version, size, encoding, etc.

For example:
	> JPEG starts with FFD8 (FF D8 FF)
	> PDF starts with %PDF (25 50 44 46)
	> ZIP starts with 50 4B 03 04

A magic number is a sequence of bytes at the beginning of a file, with the purpose of identifying the file type.

A footer is a sequence of bytes at the end of a file, indicating its conclusion.
	> JPEG ends with FFD9.
	> PDF ends with %%EOF.
	> Some file types, like MP3, lack a fixed footer, requiring more structural analysis.

Each file has a header and footer distinguishing the beginning and end of the file.

Each file type will have a unique header and footer.

The header can also be referred to as a magic number.

On the disk we are trying to identify specific types of file headers and/or footers, and carve out blocks between these two
markers.

Not all files have standard footers, and these can be difficult to work with.

Most file types have standard headers and footers.

To recover data, an analyst can carve out everything between the JPEG header and footer, and recover the image.

A HEX editor can be used to work with the disk/image.

File Structure Based Carving uses the internal layout of a file.

This looks at the header, footer, and file metadata.

Popular carvers use this technique.

Content-based carving is used to recover file data that has not been recovered from file structure carving.

This uses machine learning and statistic-based algorithms to look for statistical patterns or signatures indicating
language or file content.

All possible data clusters are gathered that appear to be related to the image. These are used to try extract and find
meaningful data and information.

Potential issues include the following:
	> No entry in file table for a given file.
	> File just exists in unallocated space.
	> File still exists in unallocated space but some sectors have been reused.
	> Files may be incomplete.
	> Majority of file carving programs will only recover files that are contiguous.
	> Files on SSDs may be fragmented.
	> Out of order and missing files.

Scalpel is a file carving and indexing application that runs on Linux and Windows.

PhotoRec is a file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents, and archives from hard
disks.

PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file
system has been severely damaged or reformatted.

Autopsy uses PhotoRec as part of its ingest modules. We will see this next week.
